# inbox-ui

## Project Description

This project is developed and represents the layout and plan of a web application control over the inbox. Project is developed to practice tailwind CSS and for the customers that want to implement this kind of design in their CRM, or want something similar for their system. The goal of this project is to show how it would look like an interface that manages user inboxes.

The application is currently not functional it's only designed and developed to show the message control interface. The plan for future development is to make a fully functional application that will be used in all companies, institutions, faculties, for personal use, etc. Also, the plan is that it can be easily implemented in an already existing CRM.

Tailwind CSS was used in making this project. The application is responsive for all devices. The development of a functional application would be further carried out using a Laravel framework.
